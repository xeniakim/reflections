When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I work with other people, when i want to backup my repositories.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If I selected to stay up-to-date, modifications that I made in local will be go away. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is similar to clone, but it allows to copy repository in Github directly. Clone means copying repository from github to local. Or it can be from local to local.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    When I make a copy of the state of remote, i can make modification of files i the repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Instead of using pull request of Github, I may use other messanger app and collaborate with other people. In this situation, I cannot merge modifications directly.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When I use only master branch, it will be easy to manage. Otherwise, if I use multiple branches, I can collaborate with others easier and try experimental codes.
